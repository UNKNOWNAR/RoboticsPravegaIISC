# Manufacturing Performance Data Story

**Analyst Email:** 24f3001857@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Executive Summary
Our manufacturing equipment efficiency is currently averaging **73.92%**, significantly trailing the industry benchmark of **90%**. While there is a positive upward trend throughout 2024, the current rate of improvement is insufficient to meet our targets without strategic intervention.

## Key Findings
- **Current Performance:** The 2024 average efficiency rate is **73.92**.
- **Trend:** We observed consistent growth from Q1 (70.45) to Q4 (77.44).
- **Gap:** We remain approximately 12.5 percentage points below the 90% target.

## Business Implications
The gap between our performance and the benchmark translates to:
- Increased downtime costs.
- Reduced production capacity.
- Higher maintenance expenses due to reactive rather than proactive repairs.

## Recommendations
To bridge this gap and reach the 90% target, we must shift from a reactive to a proactive maintenance strategy.

**Solution:** **Implement predictive maintenance program.**

By leveraging IoT sensors and real-time data analytics, we can predict equipment failures before they occur, optimizing maintenance schedules and maximizing uptime.
